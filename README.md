## Installation: 
1.    Copy files for the limited test of CS2 to the folder  
     Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg    
2.   Set the keys for the program in the file dojo.cfg   

Default Keys:  
F1 = Next spawn

F6 = Rethrow  

## How to use:
1.   Open CS2 -> press `Play` -> `Practice` -> `Competitive` 

2.   Choose the map you want to play -> press `Go`

3.   Open the console and write `exec dojo`  
   To restart the config in this session write `dojo` in console.

4.   Choose a practice mode
    - After writing `exec dojo` you are given 2 options.  
      * To choose the [freestyle mode](https://github.com/craykos/cs2-dojo-config#freestyle-mode) write `i1` in console.  
      * To choose the [instant smokes mode](https://github.com/craykos/cs2-dojo-config#instant-smokes-mode) write `i2` in console.

### freestyle mode
 - You start with an AK, molotov, smokegrenade, he and flash.  
   M4A1-S, M4A4 and incendiary grenade are lying on the floor for optional use.
