## Installation: 
1.    Copy files `dojo.cfg, dojoBindings.cfg, dojoOff.cfg` and the `folder dojo` for CS2 to the folder  
     Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg    
2.   Set the keys for the program in the file dojobindings.cfg   

Default Keys:  
F4 = Next spawn  
F5 = Same spawn again  
F6 = Reveals lineup  
F7 = Clears smoke  
F8 = Rethrow 
 
j = Places bot        
k = Kicks all bots         
l = Toggle bot crouch 

## How to use:
1.   Open CS2 -> press `Play` -> `Practice` -> `Competitive` 

2.   Choose the map you want to play -> press `Go`

3.   Open the console and write `exec dojo`  
   To restart the config in this session write `dojo` in console.

4.   Choose a practice mode
    - After writing `exec dojo` you are given 2 options.  
      * To choose the [freestyle mode](https://github.com/craykos/cs2-dojo-config#freestyle-mode) write `i1` in console.  
      * To choose the [instant smokes mode](https://github.com/craykos/cs2-dojo-config#instant-smokes-mode) write `i2` in console.

### freestyle mode
 - You start with an AK, molotov, smokegrenade, he and flash.  
   M4A1-S, M4A4 and incendiary grenade are lying on the floor for optional use.
 - Move freely through the map and practice your utility
 - Clear smokes with `F7` (Default Key, modify in dojobindings.cfg)      
 - To rethrow grenades press `F8` (Default Key, modify in dojobindings.cfg)  
 - To place a bot press `j` (Default Key, modify in dojobindings.cfg)  
 - To kick all bots press `k` (Default Key, modify in dojobindings.cfg)  
 - To toggle between crouch and standing bots press `l` (Default Key, modify in dojobindings.cfg)

Tip: Bind the command `noclip` to a key for fast movement through the map.  
  - To toggle noclip with the middle mouse button write  
       `bind mouse3 noclip` in console

### instant smokes mode  
5. You receive a list of supported maps. Choose the one you are currently on.  
   Write `imirage` to load the instant smokes for mirage.

   You are on the wrong map? You want to change the map to mirage for example?   
   Write `changelevel de_mirage` in console  
   and `dojo` in console after the map change to restart the config. 
 
6. After loading the instant smokes with `i<mapname>` you are given 2 options  
   To practice with lineups write `i1` in console.  
   To practice without help write `i2` in console.
